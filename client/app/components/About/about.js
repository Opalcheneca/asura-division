    <h1> THE IDEA BEHIND ASURA</h1>
    <p>First let me welcome you to the The Asura Division. Some people already asked me, what is Asura: In short Asura by the chinese books is a spirit with the highest Spiritual Power from all of the Realms. Asura are the strongest and the most beautiful Spirits. They step where they want and how they want to, nothing can stop them and except to kau-tau before them others have no other choice. Even the heavens must  bow before them.</p>
    <p>This is the energy which we want to create, we want to say that each and every one of us has Ultimate significance. You are important and no one will be above us! The other virtue we want to create is a division that acts and thinks as one. We protect each other, we fight together,  we rise up together and we fall together. We want to create unity, a place where you will feel numerous. </p>
    <p>This game community is created with clear purpose. To unite, rise and conquer while playing games. We will unite ourselves, rise as individuals and as group, and than we will conquer the world. Either with battles, respect, fear or love.</p>
