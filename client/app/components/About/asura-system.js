    <p>For now we have 3 branches: The Asura Division which is the current branch, The Asura God Division and The Asura Market. For the last two it is too early for any of you to know about. Because it may be bad for your “cultivation”. When the time comes you will know everything.

Let us first discuss the system behind The Asura Division (AD for short).
We have two currencies:
MERIT (M) : this is the VR currency. It indicates the contribution you are making to AD and to each and every single one of our members. You will need MERIT: to do, open, create, and receive things. Also the hierarchy is based on how much merit you possess.
Heavenly Crystals (HC): This is our converted Real Money. They are only at the Asura Market. It is too early to speak for that.

In here we have strong hierarchy. Everyone will be given a chance to rise up to the top in The Asura Division. 

AD is divide on Five Palaces:
Martial Palace: This is our battle palace, and mostly all of us will be here.
Guardian Palace: They have high authority, a word from a guardian must not be taken lightly. This is the palace for the people which want to help with the micro management of the AD. You need to be fair, calm, understandable and highly disciplined because you will have huge impact on AD’s future development. (No free slots at this moment)
Scientist Palace: Those are the creators behind the Asura Division, the macro management and the support of AD. For here you need to have some programming, designer, financing, language skills based on the title you will choose to wear. (no free slots at the moment)
Hearth Palace: This is additional palace for the highly skilled players. Here you can choose to be an Instructor (Trainer/Coach), a Sage (Account booster) and many more. We will give additional information for how to apply for this palace later on. (not implemented YET)
Guest Palace: For Official Guests of AD. 


Now is your chance to decide for which Palace you will apply. 

Every Palace has Dao Tree (hierarchy). And to climb up the hierarchy you will need Merit. Each month you will receive Merit given your current position on the Dao Tree. The Higher you go on the tree the more merit you will get. The Dao Tree on each Palace is as follows:</p>
