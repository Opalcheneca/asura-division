    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>Even though i don’t like rules we need to have some in order to prosper. We need @everyone to read them. And we need confirmation that you did exactly that.

First and the most important one is: 

For the other World, The Asura Division does not exist. No information must be given to the outside world. Not for our rules, not for our system, not for our market, not for anything.
No one else should know what we are. Keep The Asura Division only for yourself. Until we are ready with our roots. This is Iron Rule.

In the chat we need to speak only in English, except for the channels which are specified for other languages.

I need to ask for everyone to download the desktop version of Discord, so we can see which games you are currently playing. This way people can be more of an assistance to you and you can be more of an assistance to the Asura. This information will be used only for your own good.

Every special deed which includes AD members needs to go through the Division, don’t go against our back. All Special deeds will be tagget with SD.

Each rule can be protested except for the iron rules. You need a list with 10% of the people who are against that rule and a member from the “Guardian Palace” whose cultivation is not less than Martial Lord.

You need to be an active member of the Asura Division. Meaning: to use the merit as fully as possible, if you are not, after 2 months of inactivity you will get the Ghost title and you will be sent to the graveyard = Inactive Asura members. When you are titled like that you will not receive monthly Merit, you can’t post favors and many more things. You become a ghost.



GENERIC RULES:

Respect the others.
If you have disagreement for something- post it in  the “ad-reports” chat below “Guardian Palace” category. They will try to do their best to help you out.
While “Guardian” decisions may not be final, they aren’t up for discussion in the “general-chat”. Take it to the relevant admin or to the “DIscipline Scholar”.
If you disagree with something - say it, no one will judge you and we will try to find the solution together. Exactly for this we created the “ad-reports” chat under “Guardian Palace”. 
Use Channels according to their title.
Don’t spam clog the general chat with images and videos.
Keep the mic screeching to a minimum in voice channels.
